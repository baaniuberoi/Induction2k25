# Induction2k25

Greetings of the Day readers!
I am Baani Uberoi. And this is a log journal as an insight to all my activities, important conversations and fun experiences during the Induction program 2k25 at GNDEC, Ludhiana. 


## Day1 (Thursday)
The day began with glee and excitement, as every fresher wore thier best clothes as they walked in the campus for the very first time, ready to be the brilliant minds of GNDEC, all headed towards the college Gurdwara Sahib.

None were prepared for the absolute divinity that they were about to experience inside the Gurdwara Sahib. Walking in to see the Darbar Sahib filled with talent and creativity in the form of young 17 year olds instilled a sense of confidence deep within me. My respect for my culture grew even more when the hall was filled with the echoes of Naam Simran sung in unison by the sangat.

However, this was not the only thing that mesmerized the being on that day. Upon seating in the auditorium, strong motivation was imbibed by every student present, from the words of wisdom of all the esteemed speakers.

After this, we were lead to our respective departments, to be seated in the classrooms that will be ours, not yet, but in the next year. Here, we were made familiar with regal values of our institution, its adaptability and beyond par strength. We were given a vision of ourselves, excelling in every sphere of our life, be it academic or extracurricular, and saw ourselves growing as a human, here in this institution.


## Day2 (Friday)
It felt like an overwhelming experience, taking not one, but two proficiency tests on the very second day, one for English and one for, the dreaful one, Mathematics. Nonetheless, my tests went good (hopefully!).

Catching up with friends after the test felt like a relief as i came to know that we all were on the boat of mixed emotions regarding the test.

Soon, we were back inside the auditorium where three speackers enlightened us about the Satya Scholarship. Apart from the scheme, i really appreciated how comfident they were on the stage, and how comfortable they made us all feel with themselves.
Next in line was a super informative session on food and healthy eating habits, busting several common myths about food and portion control.

Well, it was now time to call it a day, however, we got a crisp session on building our first GitHub project, under the title of the induction program, where seniors talked about READMEs, markdown language and other cool stuff.


## Day3 (Saturday)


## Day4 (Monday)

The morning session started with two beautiful seniors that welcomed us for our first P2P lecture. It felt awesome to learn from someone whom you would aspire to become like one day, confident, friendly and ofcourse, knowledgeable to the core. They provided us with an insight into the world of C++, the very first language of every techie like me. 

Next we began with our BEEE lecture, during which, all the cables, wires, and switchboards, weaved the threads of AC/DC into my head in the form of an exquisite circuit.

Soon after the break, we went inside the auditorium to let ourselves get aweinspired by Mrs. Priya Darshini, as she talked about Universal Human Values. I found myself deeply invested in the lecture, writing everything I could hear of during those 2 hours of my day.

Finally, before dispersal we were made familiar with the Causmic Club by our seniors. They mentioned about how they'll help us in speaking confidently on the stage in front of a whole bunch of people, and mind you, they were so comfortable with the stage themselves. No stage-fear at all, I mean, how cool is that!


## Day5 (Tuesday)

Today was a short one, especially for the CSE-A students, invested in formation of their first ID at GNDEC.
